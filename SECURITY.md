## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. **API Keys**: Keep your Supabase credentials secure
3. **Private Keys**: Generated private keys should be stored securely
4. **Updates**: Keep the application updated to the latest version
5. **Network Security**: Use secure connections when accessing databases

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All security-related changes require thorough review
2. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and external data
4. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
5. **Testing**: Test security-related changes thoroughly

### For Deployment

1. **Firewall**: Configure appropriate firewall rules
2. **Access Control**: Restrict database access to necessary users only
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activity or access patterns
4. **Backups**: Maintain secure backups of critical data
5. **Logging**: Implement secure logging practices

## Known Security Considerations

### Private Key Storage
- Private keys are stored in base58 format in the database
- Local backup files contain private keys in plain text
- Consider additional encryption for production deployments

### Database Security
- Supabase RLS policies should be configured appropriately
- Monitor database access and usage patterns
- Consider using service role keys only when necessary

### Network Security
- All database communication uses HTTPS
- API keys should be rotated regularly
- Consider VPN access for remote deployments

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Patch releases** (1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.) for critical fixes
- **Minor releases** (1.1.0, 1.2.0, etc.) for security improvements
- **Major releases** (2.0.0, 3.0.0, etc.) for breaking security changes

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- Vulnerabilities are disclosed after fixes are available
- Credit is given to security researchers
- Coordinated disclosure with affected parties
- Clear communication about impact and mitigation

## Security Contacts

- **Security Team**: [INSERT EMAIL]
